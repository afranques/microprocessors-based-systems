# Mastermind

Implementation of the classic [Mastermind game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) in
[68000 Assembly](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/68000_Assembly) (the assembly language for the Motorola 68K-series microprocessors),
and assembled/simulated it with [EASy68K](http://www.easy68k.com/).

_A fairly detailed description of the code structure can be found at Memoria_PicazoFranquesA2A.pdf, although it's in Spanish. I will soon start translating
it to English. However, I originally wrote the code (comments and variable names) in Spanish, and that will probably still make it hard 
to read for most part of the people._
